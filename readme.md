⭐ Introducing the 2025 edition of CM Answers! With 20+ new features and over 50 customizable front-end labels, you can now personalize your Q&A forum like never before.

**Our WordPress Q&A plugin allows users to easily submit and respond to questions.**

Boost your WordPress site with CM Answers, an all-encompassing Q&A plugin that integrates seamlessly into your site. Perfect for setting up a dedicated Q&A network like StackOverflow or Quora, or just to enhance a page, it comes packed with features such as multilingual support, voting, moderation, tailored notifications, access control, flexible shortcodes, and reCAPTCHA for secure user interactions.

## Installation and Usage

### Plugin Installation

> [User Guide](https://creativeminds.helpscoutdocs.com/category/987-answers-cma)

* Upload the plugin folder to the /wp-content/plugins/ directory.
* Go to the ‘Plugins’ menu in WordPress and activate the plugin.
* Control your CM Answers plugin from the admin dashboard on the left side.

Note: Your template needs to include a wp_head() function call to ensure JavaScript plugin files function correctly. Should your theme lack this feature, you’ll have to link the files directly within your theme, which is not advisable.

### How can I customize the look and feel of the Answers plugin?

To personalize the appearance of the Answers plugin, create a “CMA” directory within your template. Mimic the structure found in “cm-answers/views/frontend/” and place your custom files there. These files will override the default ones if found; if not, the plugin’s default files will be utilized.

## Question Answer Plugin Premium Editions

The [premium version of the answers plugin](https://www.cminds.com/cm-answer-store-page-content/) features ChatGPT integration, payment options, compatibility with WooCommerce and Easy Digital Downloads, and allows users who are not logged in to post questions and answers.

## Question Moderation and Notification
